# Test

**This program is an exercise in moving and manipulating data in JSON objects, and 
also explores moving files around using the Ruby STDLIB**

  **Objectives**
  * Create directory
  * Fill it with 20 files with names that are not GUIDs
  * These files must have a json extension with sample json content with at least 4 fields 
  * One field must be a "version" field.  
  * Move these files to another directory renaming the files using GUIDs
  * Edit the version field's minor value to be +1


**Todos**
* Make fully exectuable
* Implement and use a fully test suite(minitest)
* Not asign random numbers to :version
* Explore and fix any other edge cases I can find
* Refactor, refactor, refactor
* Extend small classes in to modules
